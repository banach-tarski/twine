## this repository

This is an archive for my Twine play-things, which can be found at the above itch.io address.

You are free to share this link and the projects in any way you like.

**folder structure:**

`/one` > Contains all finished projects with their respective numbering.

`/working` > May contain some files that I'm currently working on.

To download and use my project files you can click on `Download ZIP` in the top-right, and then search through the directory for the `.tws` file. You will need to have [Twine Version 1.4.2](http://twinery.org/) to open them!

Instead of downloading you can also clone this repository with [git](http://www.git-scm.com/) or [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).

## what is going to happen here?

I will update this repository every week when I release a new play-thing.
It will contain all my project source files and the material I used.

## what is a "play-thing"?

I call these Twine games "play-things" since I wouldn't say that they are full-fledged "games". Rather they are experiments and small, little experiences that might sometimes be shorter or longer, sometimes be more complex or rather simple and sometimes might not fully work under the definition "game".
So they are things, that you can play: Play-things!
